# Weather Extension

# What is it?
![Weather Extension Image](https://i.ibb.co/7jQXLgz/Screenshot-2024-08-28-10-14-13-AM.png)
A weather extension with a simplistic ui, no paid plans, ads or paywalls.
Heavily inspired by Apple's Weather app

# How do I install this?
Its still a work in progress, but I've left a zip file in the releases section. Unzip it and go to edge://extensions or chrome://extensions (no firefox support right now, sorry!) and click load unpacked. It's a bit big (mostly video files); I may shrink those videos in the future.
